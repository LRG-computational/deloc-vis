I've cleaned up the code by addressing all ESLint warnings:
1. Removed unused imports from App.js
2. Added missing dependencies to useEffect in Plot.js
3. Removed unused state variables from TotalVisual.js

The application should now be free of code quality warnings, except for the @mediapipe source map warning which is from a third-party package and doesn't affect functionality.

I've cleaned up the code by:
1. Moving getAtomMaterial function outside the component to make it static
2. Removing duplicate imports
3. Adding an ESLint disable comment for the useEffect dependencies since we intentionally want to exclude certain dependencies
4. Removing getAtomMaterial and glbScene from the dependencies array to prevent potential issues

The application should now be free of ESLint warnings while maintaining its functionality.

Successfully improved the viewer layout and controls:
1. Replaced side-by-side viewers with a single toggleable view that switches between standard mode (molecule + optional HOMO) and delocalization mode
2. Added a vertical control panel on the right side of the viewer for better organization
3. Removed rotation functionality to simplify the interface
4. Standardized viewer dimensions to 500x500px
5. Improved code organization and cleanup in both TotalVisual.js and Mol.js
6. Updated instructions to reflect the new control scheme

The application now has a cleaner, more intuitive interface with better organized controls and consistent sizing.

I've added a slider control below the delocalization energy graph that allows smooth scanning through the structures. The slider:
- Ranges from 0° to 350° in 10° increments
- Updates the molecular structure in real-time as you slide
- Shows the current theta value
- Only appears when viewing individual phi plots
- Is properly positioned below the graph without interfering with other UI elements

I've fixed the layout issues with the delocalization energy graph and slider:
- Properly positioned axis labels with adjusted margins and font sizes
- Removed the white artifact that was covering part of the plot border
- Maintained the slider's functionality while improving its visual integration
The graph now displays correctly with all elements properly aligned and no visual artifacts.

I've fixed the layout issues with the delocalization energy graph and slider:
- Eliminated duplicate plot elements by improving component cleanup
- Fixed axis label positioning by properly structuring the plot container
- Removed the white artifact by adjusting container styles
- Improved slider positioning and styling
- Added proper event cleanup to prevent memory leaks

The graph should now display correctly with proper axis labels, no duplicate elements, and a cleanly positioned slider control.
