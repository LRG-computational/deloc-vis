## Task
Analyze and identify an error from a GitHub Actions build log related to disk space issues.

## Report

### Project Context and Objectives
I was asked to analyze a build error log from what appears to be a GitHub Actions workflow. The objective was to identify and explain the root cause of a build failure.

### System Architecture and Technical Design
The system appears to be using:
- GitHub Actions as the CI/CD platform
- Ruby (version 3.3.0) as part of the build process
- File operations involving copy_file_range functionality

### Implementation Details
The error analysis revealed a critical disk space issue:
```
/usr/local/lib/ruby/3.3.0/fileutils.rb:2280:in `copy_stream': No space left on device - copy_file_range (Errno::ENOSPC)
```
This indicates that the GitHub Actions runner exhausted its available disk space during file operations.

### Testing Approach and Quality Assurance
The error was identified through log analysis, examining the specific error message and its context within the Ruby file operations system.

### Issues Encountered and Solutions
Main Issue:
- GitHub Actions runner ran out of disk space during build process

Recommended Solutions:
1. Add node_modules/ to .gitignore
2. Clean up unnecessary repository files
3. Implement actions/cache for dependency management
4. Consider workflow optimization or splitting deployment into smaller chunks
5. Evaluate using a GitHub Actions workflow with larger disk allocation
