## Task 
Investigate and fix GitHub Pages build failure for React application deployment

## Report

### Project Context and Objectives
I was tasked with investigating a GitHub Pages build failure where Jekyll was attempting to build a React application. The objective was to properly configure the project for GitHub Pages deployment while ensuring the React build process works correctly.

### System Architecture and Technical Design
The system consists of:
- Frontend: React application to be hosted on GitHub Pages
- Backend: Python/Flask API hosted on Render
- Build System: Using gh-pages package for deployment

### Implementation Details
I made the following changes:
1. Updated the homepage field in package.json to point to the correct GitHub Pages URL:
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://lrg-computational.github.io/deloc-vis"
   ```
2. Created a .nojekyll file in the frontend directory to disable Jekyll processing
3. Verified existing gh-pages dependency and deployment scripts were already in place:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "predeploy": "npm run build",
     "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
   }
   ```

### Testing Approach and Quality Assurance
The implementation can be tested by:
1. Running `npm run deploy` from the frontend directory
2. Verifying the deployment on GitHub Pages
3. Testing API connectivity between the GitHub Pages hosted frontend and Render backend

### Issues Encountered and Solutions
1. Main Issue: Jekyll trying to process React build files
   - Solution: Added .nojekyll file to disable Jekyll processing
   
2. Build Space Issue: "No space left on device" error
   - Solution: Proper configuration of build output and disabling Jekyll processing should resolve this

The changes made should allow for proper deployment of the React application to GitHub Pages while maintaining the connection to the backend API.
