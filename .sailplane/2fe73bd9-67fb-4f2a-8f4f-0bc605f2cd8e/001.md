## Task 
Configure Render backend to properly connect with GitHub Pages frontend

## Report
### Project Context and Objectives
I was tasked with configuring the Render-hosted backend to properly communicate with a frontend deployed on GitHub Pages. The main objective was to ensure proper CORS configuration while maintaining local development capabilities.

### System Architecture and Technical Design
The system consists of:
- Frontend: React application hosted on GitHub Pages (lrg-computational.github.io/deloc-vis)
- Backend: Flask API hosted on Render (deloc-vis-backend.onrender.com)
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration to enable secure communication

### Implementation Details
1. Updated backend CORS configuration in app.py:
   - Replaced wildcard CORS (*) with specific allowed origins
   - Added GitHub Pages domain (https://lrg-computational.github.io)
   - Maintained localhost:3000 for development
2. Verified frontend configuration:
   - Confirmed production API URL in .env.production points to Render backend
   - No changes needed to render.yaml or other deployment configs

### Testing Approach and Quality Assurance
Recommended testing steps:
1. Deploy updated backend to Render
2. Deploy frontend to GitHub Pages
3. Verify API calls from the deployed site
4. Test key functionality to ensure CORS is working

### Issues Encountered and Solutions
- Initial CORS configuration was too permissive (allowing all origins)
- Solution: Implemented specific origin allowlist for better security while maintaining functionality
- IDE showed Pylance errors but these were local-only and don't affect production deployment
