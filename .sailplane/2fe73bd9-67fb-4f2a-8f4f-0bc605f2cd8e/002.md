## Task 
Advise on environment variable configuration in Render portal for the deloc-vis project.

## Report

### Project Context and Objectives
I was asked to evaluate whether environment variables needed to be updated in the Render portal for the deloc-vis project. The main objective was to ensure proper CORS configuration between the frontend (hosted on GitHub Pages) and the backend (hosted on Render).

### System Architecture and Technical Design
The system uses a split architecture:
- Frontend: Hosted on GitHub Pages (https://lrg-computational.github.io)
- Backend: Hosted on Render
- Communication between these components requires proper CORS configuration

### Implementation Details
After analyzing the .env.example file, I identified that the ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable needs to be configured in the Render portal. The recommended configuration is:
```
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://lrg-computational.github.io
```
This configuration allows requests from both the local development environment and the production GitHub Pages domain.

### Testing Approach and Quality Assurance
The recommended testing process includes:
1. Updating the environment variable in Render
2. Redeploying the backend service
3. Deploying the frontend to GitHub Pages
4. Verifying the cross-origin communication works correctly

### Issues Encountered and Solutions
While the CORS configuration was already updated in app.py, maintaining consistency between the code and environment variables is important for system reliability and maintainability. The solution was to recommend updating both the hardcoded CORS configuration and the environment variable to ensure robust cross-origin resource sharing.
