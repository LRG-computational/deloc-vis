## Task 
Update CORS configuration to allow requests from Netlify domain and provide deployment instructions.

## Report
### Project Context and Objectives
The task involved preparing the application for deployment to Netlify by ensuring proper CORS configuration in the backend to accept requests from Netlify domains. This was necessary as part of migrating the hosting from GitHub Pages to Netlify.

### System Architecture and Technical Design
The system consists of:
- Frontend: React application to be hosted on Netlify
- Backend: Flask API hosted on Render.com
- CORS middleware to control cross-origin requests

### Implementation Details
Modified the CORS configuration in app.py to allow requests from:
- Netlify default domains (*.netlify.app)
- Specific Netlify domain (deloc-vis.netlify.app)
- Existing allowed domains (GitHub Pages and localhost)

The implementation ensures both development and production environments are properly configured.

### Testing Approach and Quality Assurance
- Verified CORS configuration syntax
- Ensured all necessary domains are included
- Maintained existing allowed origins to prevent disruption

### Issues Encountered and Solutions
- IDE showed Pylance errors for Flask imports, but these were identified as local IDE issues that won't affect production deployment
- Addressed potential domain flexibility by including both wildcard Netlify domain and specific domain patterns

The changes provide a robust CORS configuration that will support the application's deployment to Netlify while maintaining security boundaries.
