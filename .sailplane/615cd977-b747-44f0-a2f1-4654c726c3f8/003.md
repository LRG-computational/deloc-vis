## Task 
Fix communication issues between Netlify frontend and Render backend by adding debugging and proper environment configuration.

## Report

### Project Context and Objectives
The project had a communication issue where the Netlify-hosted frontend wasn't successfully communicating with the Render-hosted backend. The objective was to diagnose and fix this issue by adding proper debugging and environment configuration.

### System Architecture and Technical Design
The system consists of:
- Frontend: React application hosted on Netlify
- Backend: Flask API hosted on Render
- Communication: REST API calls from frontend to backend

### Implementation Details
1. Added API URL Debugging in api.js:
```javascript
const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL;
console.log('API URL:', API_URL);
if (!API_URL) {
  console.error('API_URL is not set! Check environment variables.');
}
```

2. Enhanced Error Handling in fetchPlotData:
```javascript
console.log('Fetching plot data from:', `${API_URL}/plot_data/${encodeURIComponent(filePath)}`);
// Added detailed response logging and error handling
```

3. Environment Configuration in netlify.toml:
```toml
[build.environment]
  CI = "false"
  REACT_APP_API_URL = "https://deloc-vis-backend.onrender.com"
```

### Testing Approach and Quality Assurance
- Added comprehensive logging throughout the API call process
- Implemented detailed error reporting for network requests
- Added response headers logging for CORS debugging
- Created a clear testing procedure using browser developer tools

### Issues Encountered and Solutions
1. Environment Variable Configuration:
   - Issue: Uncertainty about API URL availability in production
   - Solution: Added direct configuration in netlify.toml

2. Debugging Limitations:
   - Issue: Lack of visibility into API requests
   - Solution: Added detailed console logging

3. Error Handling:
   - Issue: Insufficient error information
   - Solution: Enhanced error handling with detailed logging of request/response details
