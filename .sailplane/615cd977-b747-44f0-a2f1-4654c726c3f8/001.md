## Task 
Migrate website from GitHub Pages to Netlify due to large repo size issues

## Report

### Project Context and Objectives
The project needed to be migrated from GitHub Pages to Netlify due to repository size limitations. The application consists of a React frontend and a Python backend, with the backend already deployed on Render.com.

### System Architecture and Technical Design
- Frontend: React application using craco for build configuration
- Backend: Python/Flask API hosted on Render.com
- Deployment: Netlify for frontend, Render for backend
- Environment Configuration: Development and Production environments properly separated

### Implementation Details
1. Frontend Configuration Updates:
   - Modified package.json to remove GitHub Pages specific settings
   - Updated homepage to "/"
   - Created netlify.toml with build settings and SPA routing
   - Added _redirects file for SPA fallback
   - Verified API configuration in .env.production

2. Build Configuration:
   - Base directory: frontend
   - Build command: npm run build
   - Publish directory: build
   - Environment variables maintained through .env files

### Testing Approach and Quality Assurance
- Verified existing API configuration points to correct Render backend
- Ensured SPA routing will work through both netlify.toml and _redirects
- Maintained existing development environment setup for local testing

### Issues Encountered and Solutions
- SPA Routing: Implemented both netlify.toml and _redirects for maximum compatibility
- Build Directory: Configured specific frontend directory in netlify.toml to handle monorepo structure
- Environment Variables: Leveraged existing .env.production configuration to maintain backend connectivity
