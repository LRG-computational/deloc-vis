   - Rotation capabilities
   - Zoom functionality
   - Isosurface visualization
3. Support multiple molecule types:
   - P3HT
   - PNDIT
   - PTB7FIN
   - PTB7FOUT
4. Provide simulation capabilities for visualizing molecular bending and torsion
5. Allow overlay of multiple plots for comparison

## Non-Functional Requirements
